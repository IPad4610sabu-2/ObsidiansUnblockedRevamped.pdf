## About  
Obsidians Unblocked Revamped is a almost complete remake of my old website Obsidians Unblocked. I completely re-coded pretty much everything in it. There is now many new features in it, such as: tab-cloaking, search for games, dynamic game loading, all one page, cookies support, simple and clean ui, better page design, and a lot more minor changes to improve the website. I am the only developer of this website currently so it isn't the best not going to lie, but I am proud of what I have created, I spent my time working on this website and it has become a memorable part of my life. It was so popular at my school at one point until recently, that the staff actually had a meeting about it lmao.
